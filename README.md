# ExpoThree - Ejected

This repo is a side-plot from this React Native Study repo, where we Ejected from an Expo app to see what the lock-in, if any, was like.

<https://github.com/rolandhordos/Study-ReactNative>

## Goal

We want to see if, at a point in time where an app was ready for distribution outside of Expo we could have the repo picked up by BuddyBuild (or other CI) and built for device with little or no side effects.
